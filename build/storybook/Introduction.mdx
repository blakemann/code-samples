# Code Samples
## A collection of web development code samples by Blake Mann

Hi, my name is Blake, and I'm a developer and designer from Calgary, Alberta, Canada. I've been working in the web development industry for over 11 years on a wide variety of projects - but most of those projects have been in team settings or on proprietary codebases where I can't easily showcase my work publicly. So, I created this Storybook project as a place where I can showcase the type of work that I do through a few examples.

### Navigating the Storybook

You can view all of the components used in the project in isolation using the navigation sidebar within this Storybook. Full example demos are visible under the '**Demos**' category, and the individual components that make up the demo can be found under '**Components**'.

### View the Source Code

All the code for this project is visible in my GitHub repo, which you can find here:

[https://github.com/blakemann/code-samples](https://github.com/blakemann/code-samples)

For Vue JS component examples, be sure to check out this directory:

**Thanks for checking out my work!**
